<h1> Our Approach </h1>

<p>
One of the primary things that stand out about Parallax Global is our unique 
point-of-view and approach to consulting engagements.
The lens through which we view every consulting engagement is a Parallax View, 
which of course, as the definition of "parallax" suggests, 
means that we take two alternate (but not necessarily opposing) 
views of every problem, and compare and contrast two alternate strategies for 
approaching the problem. This ensures that individuals, teams and management do not 
become victims of their own paradigms 
(read Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions for more on this), 
that we don't get lazy, and that we can assure
 our clients of the deepest and most creative approaches to their problems, every time.
